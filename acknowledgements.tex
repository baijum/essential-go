First and foremost, I thank my God for enabling me to write this book.
I want to thank my wife, Nithya and our two sons, Aadidev \& Aarav for
their love, care, and support.  I also want to thank my colleagues and
friends for all the help.

I have received much feedback from my colleagues, friends, and fellow
Go community members, including Satish V.J., Nurali Virani, Preeti
Chandrashekar, Parvathy V.R., Sunil Malagi, Bilal M.K, Iliyas Shirol,
Pratik Shah, and Andrei Tudor CÄƒlin.

The encouragement I received from the Go community is terrific.  I am
grateful for being part of the Go community.
